## Overview
Bookish Insight is a web application designed to cater to book enthusiasts who enjoy reading, reviewing, and organizing books. It offers a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and interactive features. The website includes various pages such as Home, Listed Books, Pages to Read, All Reviews, Subscribe Us, and dynamic routes for Book Details and Read Page.

## Key Features
- **Navbar**: A persistent navigation bar with the website name and menu items for easy access to different sections of the website. The active route is highlighted for user convenience.

- **Banner Section**: A visually appealing banner section displaying a title and a button to view the listed books page. Clicking the button redirects users to the Listed Books page.

- **Book Cards**: The website showcases book cards arranged according to Figma specifications. Each card includes essential information such as image, tags, book name, author, category, and rating.

- **Book Details Page**: Dynamic route for viewing detailed information about a book. It includes the book's image, name, author, category, review, tags, total pages, publisher, year of publishing, and rating. Users can add the book to their read list or wishlist from this page.
